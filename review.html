    <h1>Review of the book</h1>

    <h3>Rating: 4/5 stars.
      I felt the book was lacking a bit in unpredictability, some parts seemed very repetitive and there were a lot of "convenient" traits about Micheal, like his photographic memory.
      There were some twists I was not at all expecting, and near the end it built a great sense of suspense that made me unable to put it down.  The book was an easy read, not much challenging vocabulary, but it was very enjoyable.
    </h3>

    <h3>I very much liked this book! The beginning did a great job of creating the characters and their traits. I liked the world building as well, showcasing just how oppressive nazi germany was for even the regular people who lived there.
      I was able to construct a kind of movie in my head while I was reading the book, and it really drew me in near the end. I've always liked Alan Gratz's writing, and this book is no different; it has a good story, great suspense, and memorable characters. What else could you really ask for?
