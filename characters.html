      <h2>Micheal O'Shaunessy</h2>
      <h3>Micheal is a tough young boy born into an irish spy family. His dad runs the irish embassy in germany, which allows a unique opportunity for him to help the allies by spying on germany from the inside.

      </h3>
      
      <h2>Pilot</h2>
      <h3>There is a pilot that Micheal finds and he plays a very important role in the story.</h3>

      <h2>Fritz</h2>
      <h3>Fritz is a boy in Micheal's class. He is Micheal's best friend, and despite being shorter than everyone else he is very fierce and dedicated. Frtiz's dad works for the german government as an architect for a new experimental plane, codenamed Projekt 1065.
        Fritz starts out acting rather timid, as during one of the book burnings he hesitates and the bigger kids beat him up for it. Later, Micheal teaches him how to fight and he gains a lot of confidence. He ends up joining the SRD, an elite division of the hitler youth, and becoming the top ranking member.
        Fritz is inevitably brainwashed by the nazi propoganda and becomes obsessed with serving his country, even going as far as reporting his parents to the gestapo. As such, he is selected to go on a life or death mission to kill a scientist that could help the allies with the manhattan project.
