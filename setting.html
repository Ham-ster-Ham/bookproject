    <h1>Setting throughout the book</h1>

    <h3>The book is set in berlin, world war 2 nazi germany. After several allied bombings, the city is looking very torn apart.
       Civilians still go about their daily lives however, hiding away in bunkers when the sirens go off almost a daily routine.
      Children are being trained to be soldiers for germany, even being recruited to the front lines straight after they graduate.
